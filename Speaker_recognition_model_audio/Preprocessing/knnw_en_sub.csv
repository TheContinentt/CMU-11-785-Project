131;592860;594540;"What?! No way!"
132;594540;597190;"Yeah, it was like you had amnesia or somethin'."
133;597190;601840;"Now that you mention it, I do feel like I've been havin' weird dreams lately."
134;601840;605860;"Like a dream about someone else's life?"
135;606020;608120;"It's all so fuzzy."
136;608120;610660;"Wait a sec, I've got it..."
137;610660;612420;"It's memories from a previous life,"
138;612420;616250;"or maybe your subconscious linked to the Everett interpretation of the multiverse!"
139;616250;617570;"Keep your full mouth shut!"
140;617570;622390;"Wait a minute! Teshi, don't tell me you were the one who wrote in my noteboo... k."
141;623080;624510;"Forget it."
142;625170;629500;"But you really were actin' just a little funny yesterday, Mitsuha."
143;629800;631730;"You been feelin' okay?"
144;632450;635450;"That's what's weird. I feel fine."
145;635580;639600;"Maybe it's from stress. You know, you've got that ritual comin' up soon, don'tcha?"
146;639600;641800;"Ugh, don't remind me!"
147;641800;646380;"I can't stand this place anymore! It's too small and town-ey."
148;646380;650870;"I wanna graduate already and go to Tokyo as soon as I can!"
149;650960;656130;"-Can't say I blame you. There really Is nothin' at all in this town."
150;657100;661660;"-There's only one train that stops here every two hours -and all the stores close at nine o' clock."

155;668620;671230;"Even the days are too short."
156;672340;673470;"You know what?!"
157;673470;675150;"- No, what? - No, what?"
158;675960;678500;"Forget that stuff. why don't we go to a café?"
159;678500;679960;"- A café? - Really?"
160;679960;681260;"- Where?! - Where?!"
161;685820;686800;"Hello, kids!"
162;686800;688160;"- Hi, there! - Evenin', ma'am!"
163;693050;696740;"- How is this a café? - Like this town's got a café."
164;697050;699680;"Mitsuha just went straight home."
165;700670;705480;"- Things have gotta be really rough for her right now. - She's on center stage and all."
166;705480;706480;"Yeah..."
167;709810;712440;"- Hey, Teshi... - Hm?"
168;712800;715900;"What are you gonna do after you graduate high school?"

170;718880;720370;"Mh-hm."
171;720660;725950;"I dunno. I think I'll probably just end up livin' in this town, y'know. Same as ever."
172;741880;743940;"I wanna do what you're doin'."
173;743940;746850;"It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha."
174;746850;749380;"Listen to the thread's voice."
175;749380;755880;"When you twine it round and round like this, feelings will start flowing between you and the thread."
176;756710;760950;"- It's not like threads talk... - She's telling you to focus."
177;760950;766570;"Etched within our braided cords is a thousand years' worth of Itomori's history."
178;766570;770620;"Listen. Somethin' happened two hundred years ago..."
179;770620;772040;"Here she goes."
180;772040;779170;"The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki caught on fire and this whole area burned down."
181;779270;782650;"The shrine and old Documents were destroyed."
182;782840;786070;"- This is known as... - Mayugoro's Great Fire."
183;786320;790600;"They named the fire after him?! I feel bad for Mayugoro."
184;791390;795150;"The meaning behind our festivals was lost because of that."
185;795150;797740;"Only the surface was left."
186;797740;802040;"But even if those words are gone, those words shouldn't fade."
187;802040;806530;"That's the Miyamizu shrine's duty. our important task."
188;807220;808830;"Ugh..."
189;808830;812660;"Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine!"
190;812660;818360;"Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving this house were bad enough, but politics?!"
191;818360;821010;"Oh, he's hopeless!"
192;821460;823540;"-Have another, mister foreman."
193;826570;830390;"- I'll be counting on your help again for this election. - Leave it to me."
194;830390;834320;"You'll get the votes from the Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts, guaranteed."
195;834320;837960;"- How's the datin' scene? - It ain't easy, that's for sure."
196;839350;843520;"- Smells like corruption in there. - What are you talkin' about?"
197;844000;847280;"- We're gonna need two or three more bottles. - Yes, dear."
198;847280;850310;"Katsuhiko, you're gonna help out at the site this weekend."
199;850310;853520;"- We'll be usin' explosives, so you better study up. - Grngh."
200;853520;854580;"What was that?!"
201;854580;856580;"Got it!"
202;869280;871930;"Guess we both can't stand things here."
203;890460;893180;"Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up."
204;893180;895900;"They're lookers, alright. Just like their mother."
205;897550;900520;"- Heya! - Hey."
206;932330;934700;"World's oldest kind of sake,"
207;934700;940660;"but chewin' on rice, spittin' it out, and then lettin' it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol."

210;945720;947910;"Yeah, of course they do!"
211;949660;953010;"Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu."
212;957500;964030;"-Ugh! I'd never do that! -And in front of everybody! Embarrassing, right?"
213;977550;979870;"You should try to cheer up, sis."
214;980040;983010;"Who cares if a few of the kids from your school saw that?"
215;983010;985940;"It must be nice for you not being a teenager."
216;986410;991000;"Hey, I know! You should just sell Kuchikamizake and move to Tokyo!"
217;991000;995860;"I bet you could sell it with all sorts of stuff like photos and making-of videos."
218;995860;1001910;"Oh, and then you can call it "Shrine maiden's Sake"! You'll make buttloads!"
219;1001890;1003890;""Shrine Maiden's Sake""
220;1004600;1008280;"I can't! There are liquor laws!"

222;1016430;1021320;"I hate this town! I hate this life, too!"
223;1021320;1028690;"Please make me a handsome tokyo boy in my next life!"

258;1276690;1278870;"- You got lost? - Yeah."
259;1278900;1283030;"Wait a second. How'd you wind up getting lost on the way to school?"
260;1283030;1284110;"Uh..."
261;1284110;1286900;"-Well, a girl- -A girl?"
262;1286900;1287870;"A gal-"

270;1302170;1304260;"-And where's your lunch?"
271;1304260;1306950;"- Seriously? - What is up with you?"
272;1306950;1310370;"- We could share somethin'. - Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich."
273;1310460;1312310;"-Yes! Hahahaha!"
274;1312930;1314730;"Ah..."
275;1314730;1316410;"Thank you!"
276;1317810;1321190;"- Wanna hit the café later? - Oh, that one? Sure."
277;1321190;1322000;"-You in, Taki?"
278;1322000;1325080;"-What? What?! WHAT?!"
279;1325080;1326360;"A café?!"
280;1329510;1333580;"- They've got nice timberwork in here. - Yeah, it's pretty intricate."
281;1333950;1335720;"Taki, all set?"
282;1335720;1337630;"Uh...[Gasp]"
283;1337630;1340860;"I could live for a whole month on what these pancakes cost!"
284;1341450;1343900;"-Uh... maybe a decade ago."
285;1343900;1345850;"-Hmmm..."
286;1345850;1348380;"Oh, well! It's only a dream!"
287;1354510;1356880;"Dreams are great!"
288;1357020;1359020;"Huh?"
289;1361560;1364970;"Wha? Oh no! I think that I'm late for work."
290;1365160;1368260;"- You got a shift today? - Guess you better get goin'."
291;1368260;1370460;"Right."
292;1371110;1373710;"Sorry, but uh..."
293;1373710;1376470;"Where exactly do I work?"
294;1376470;1377910;"- Wha? - Wha?"
295;1383940;1388430;"- Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting! - Table twelve! Taki!"
296;1388430;1389490;"Got it!"
297;1389700;1391020;"Here you go."
298;1391020;1394250;"So, the zucchini and tomato salad with a side of..."
299;1394350;1395590;"- We didn't order that! - Wha?"
300;1395590;1400320;"- Taki! I told you that we are out of truffles! - Taki, you gotta talk louder!"
301;1400320;1401500;"Taki!"
302;1402610;1404940;"When is this nightmare gonna be over?!"
303;1413260;1414500;"Diner: Waiter."
304;1414780;1418080;"- Hey, you. - Uh, yes?"
305;1418880;1422420;"See this? Does it look right? a toothpick's in it."
306;1422730;1425420;"What would have happened if we ate it?"
307;1425710;1428370;"It's really lucky I noticed when I did."
308;1428940;1432790;"-Do something. -Uh... it's just that..."
309;1432850;1436770;"Well, I don't even think we have toothpicks at this-"
310;1436770;1438820;"What?!"
311;1438820;1442450;"Excuse me. Is everything alright over here?"
312;1442450;1445760;"- Well, like I was trying to tell the guy... - I'll take care of this."
313;1446250;1448420;"What's wrong with you today?"
314;1449300;1452690;"We truly apologize. your meal is on the house tonight."
315;1452690;1453840;"Why, thank you."
316;1454030;1456490;"You weren't hurt, were you?"
317;1466660;1470710;"- Uh... Oku... dera? - That's "Miss" to you."
318;1470990;1474740;"-Miss Okudera. About before- -We just had some bad luck is all."
319;1474740;1478260;"-No, I- I- -Those guys were definitely scamming us."
320;1478260;1481330;"I handled it according to the manual, but still..."
321;1481660;1484570;"Uh-Ms. Okudera, your skirt!"
322;1485800;1488000;"- Are you alright? - Did something happen?"
323;1488000;1489920;"Looks like someone cut it."
324;1489920;1491910;"That guy..."
325;1492340;1494910;"- Do you remember what he looked like? - No..."
326;1494980;1498750;"- Come with me. - Hey, Taki."
327;1499390;1500730;"Okay, take off your skirt."
328;1500730;1501590;"What?!"
329;1501590;1503360;"N- wh- I'll... I'll look the other way!"
330;1507830;1509850;"Hold on, this won't take long."
331;1514090;1516520;"All done! Ta-da!"
332;1516840;1520510;"You're really good, Taki! It's way cuter now!"
333;1521770;1526620;"By the way, I wanted to thank you for all your help with that customer earlier."
334;1527130;1531000;"To be honest, well... I was worried about you."
335;1531000;1535000;"You aren't that strong, but you're quick to pick a fight."
336;1535000;1537040;"I like you better today."
337;1537280;1540720;"You've got a feminine side. who woulda guessed?"
338;1541960;1543960;""JR Yamanote Line: 7 min.""
339;1551390;1555220;"I gotta say, this dream sure does seem real."
340;1559290;1562080;"Ah, looks like he keeps a journal."
341;1566290;1567990;"So organized."
342;1568590;1571490;"I wish I lived in Tokyo."
343;1574890;1576670;"One of her."
344;1581280;1583830;"Unrequited love?"
345;1588530;1594540;""Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera after work, thanks to my feminine powers!""

357;1644700;1646680;"Huh?...Ah!"
358;1646680;1650740;"Wait a second. Was that you, Tsukasa? Are you the one that's been messing with my phone?"
359;1650790;1653370;"Uh... Never mind."
360;1653690;1655120;"Later."
361;1655120;1657720;"Well, he's back to normal."
362;1657720;1660440;"I think he was kinda... cute yesterday."

380;1726650;1730220;"I feel like everyone's starin' at me for some reason."
381;1730460;1734680;"- Well you did kinda make a scene yesterday. - Uh?!"
382;1735150;1737150;""Still-life drawing""
383;1736210;1738320;"-Did you see all the election posters?"
384;1738320;1741490;"-Doesn't matter who wins, nothin'll change, 'cept for who gets the kickback."
385;1741490;1746010;"-Shhh! Somebody's daddy's dependent on it."
386;1746200;1748080;"-They're talking about me, right?"
387;1748080;1750460;"Uh... [Nod]"

400;1808380;1813140;"At last, hello, you've opened your eyes,"
401;1813140;1818690;"but why won't you even look me in the eyes, what's wrong with you?"
402;1818690;1823250;"You angrily tell me that I'm late."
403;1823250;1827990;"Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best and running at my fastest pace!"
404;1827990;1830740;"Mitsuha: I'm slowly beginning to realize what's going on."
405;1830850;1834200;"Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo."
406;1834860;1840490;"Taki: Two or three times a week, I'll suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha, who's somewhere out in the boonies."
407;1840500;1844540;"The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown."
408;1841490;1843990;""Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown""
409;1844580;1849390;"Mitsuha: Any memories I have of the switch get more and more hazy after I wake up."
410;1849390;1852450;"Taki: But there's no doubt that we're switching places."
411;1852450;1855150;"The reactions of everyone around us prove it."
412;1855150;1856620;"And that's why..."
413;1856620;1861730;"Mitsuha: That's why we decided to lay out some ground rules so we could protect each other's way of life."
414;1857850;1861040;""Strictly forbidden!""
415;1861180;1864130;""No baths! No looking! No touching!""
416;1861730;1866530;"Things to watch out for during the switches, and a list of stuff we should never do."
417;1864230;1867470;""Don't waste money! no dialect! Don't be late!""
418;1866600;1871160;"Taki: We also agreed to leave each other reports on our phones on the days we switch places..."
419;1871160;1875560;"Mitsuha: So that we can work together to get through this... weird thing that's happening."
420;1876160;1877570;"-And yet..."

423;1881520;1884100;"Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,"
424;1884100;1886100;"been looking everywhere for you."
425;1886100;1888590;"I followed the sound of your innocent laughter,"
426;1888590;1891690;"and it guided me in the right way."
427;1891690;1894210;"Even if every piece of you disappeared"
428;1894210;1896450;"and if it scattered everywhere..."
429;1896450;1899110;"Mitsuha: Guys will stare. Watch the skirt!"
430;1899110;1901810;"These are basics for a girl!"
431;1899620;1900950;""Careful with skirts!""
432;1904250;1909410;"Taki: Stop wasting my money on sweets! mitsuha: It's goin' in your body. Plus, I also worked for that money."

434;1909410;1911070;"Taki: Braiding cords is impossible!"

436;1914660;1919210;"I wonder if we can push our way through"
437;1919210;1924910;"the countless barrier that's waiting In the future just beyond our view."
438;1924910;1929420;"Side-by-side, no way we can lose."
439;1929420;1934520;"We'll beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules."
440;1935040;1939700;"Mitsuha: Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the way home. You two have a good thing going!"
441;1939700;1943210;"Taki: Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha!"
442;1943210;1946850;"-Hey, Taki... why is a girl confessing her love to me?"
443;1946850;1949350;"-Maybe you're just more Popular when I'm you."
444;1949350;1952490;"-You're so full of yourself! like you have a girlfriend!"
445;1949940;1952360;""Don't be so full of yourself!!""
446;1952490;1953970;"-It's not like you have anyone, either!"
447;1953970;1955720;"- I don't... - I don't..."

450;1955720;1957870;"- Because I don't want a relationship! - Because I don't want a relationship!"
451;1979500;1982210;"I shouldn't for her sake."
452;1985390;1987710;"Yotsuha: You sure do like your own boobies."
453;1987970;1991960;"Time to go! Get ready!"
454;1993000;1999810;"Over the course of the last few days, the Tiamat comet has been visible, but when and where can people see it?"
455;1999240;2005250;""Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee""
456;1999930;2006980;"The Tiamat comet will be moving in the same direction the sun does: from East to West from our point of view."
457;2007450;2010310;"Why are you wearin' your uniform?"
458;2017900;2023370;"Yotsuha: Grandma, why does our shrine god's relic have to be kept so far away?"
459;2023370;2026830;"'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know."
460;2026830;2030420;"- Who's Mayugoro? - What? He's famous!"
461;2038150;2040340;"Hop on, grandma."
462;2044570;2046780;"- Oh! - Watch out! Careful!"
463;2057740;2062070;"Mitsuha. Yotsuha. Do you know about Musubi?"
464;2062070;2063200;"Mu... subi?"
465;2063200;2069060;"It's what we used to call the local guardian Deity long ago, and it means "union"."
466;2069060;2072300;"This word has profound meaning."
467;2072300;2080300;"Tying strings together is a union, connecting to People is a union, and the flow of time is a union."
468;2080870;2087710;"These are all part of the god's power. The braided cords that we make are tied to that."
469;2087710;2093270;"A skill from the god, they represent the flow of time itself."
470;2093970;2101940;"They assemble and take shape. They twist, tangle, unravel now and then, break..."
471;2101940;2104050;"and reconnect."
472;2104230;2108240;"That's what a union is. What time is."
473;2111310;2114080;"- Have a drink. - Thanks."
474;2114560;2119100;"- I want some, too! - That's also a union."
475;2119650;2126310;"Whether it's water, rice or sake, when something becomes a part of a person, it's a union."
476;2126310;2132960;"It joins their soul, which is why the offering we're making today is such an important custom."
477;2132960;2136350;"It connects the god with people."
478;2137990;2140110;"Hey, I can see it!"
479;2142990;2148980;"This is where it is. the sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine."
480;2164220;2170490;"What lies ahead is the hereafter. It's the netherworld."
481;2171780;2174360;"The netherworld!"
482;2175950;2183170;"In order to return to this world, you have to leave behind what is most important to you."
483;2185160;2188380;"Like the kuchikamizake."
484;2188400;2190230;"Kuchikamizake?"
485;2190230;2197160;"You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic. After all, it is half of you."
486;2198830;2201670;"Half... of Mitsuha."
487;2218970;2222010;"Wow, it's already magic hour!"
488;2222090;2224010;"Magic hour?"

490;2240320;2243490;"Oh, Mitsuha..."
491;2243490;2246990;"you're dreaming right now, aren't you?"
492;2258050;2260950;"I'm crying? But why?"
493;2263010;2265510;""I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!""
494;2266130;2269820;"Ms. Okudera? She's almost where?"

740;3632220;3636020;"if it's true, and time can be unraveled,"
741;3636020;3639070;"just give me one more chance."
742;3649290;3650940;"Agh!"
743;3651360;3652780;"[Gasp]"
744;3652780;3655000;"A comet!"
745;3661030;3664030;"ngh! Hh..."
746;3708200;3716790;"[Heartbeat]"
747;3716790;3720930;"- [Crying] - Your name's going to be..."
748;3720930;3722180;"Mitsuha."
749;3728670;3731040;"Both of you are my treasures."
750;3731040;3734140;"You're going to be a big sister!"
751;3733320;3734790;""Get well soon, Mom!""
752;3736060;3740310;"I'm so sorry, my dears..."
753;3740770;3743980;"Dad, when is mommy coming home?"
754;3744760;3748080;"- I couldn't help her! - Get ahold of yourself!"
755;3748080;3751350;"- Who cares about the shrine?! - But you're in charge now!"
756;3751350;3755260;"- I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine! - Get out!"
757;3758550;3760540;"Now listen to me, girls."
758;3760540;3764980;"Starting today, you'll be living with grandma."
759;3769180;3770430;""Who are you?""
760;3769220;3771800;""Who am I?" Who are you?"
761;3770430;3771680;""Mitsuha""
762;3771680;3772780;""Idiot""
763;3771800;3773290;"Don't be full of yourself!"
764;3773290;3775380;"Like you have a girlfriend!"
765;3775380;3776800;"Must be nice."
766;3776800;3779310;"They've probably met up about now."
767;3780480;3781830;"Why am I...?"
768;3781830;3786090;"- I'm going to Tokyo. - What?! Wait, Sis!"
769;3787540;3789050;"Grandma?"
770;3789050;3792080;"Would you mind doing me a favor?"
771;3792080;3795100;"Oh yeah, the comet."
772;3795100;3798170;"It'll be at its brightest today, right?"
773;3798170;3800570;"-Mitsuha, don't go there!"
774;3801230;3802620;"Mitsuha!"
775;3802620;3806070;"You've gotta get out of town before the comet strikes!"
776;3806070;3808160;"[Gasp]"
777;3808160;3810600;"Mitsuha, run!"
778;3810660;3817340;"Mitsuha! Mitsuha! Mitsuha!"
779;3822540;3825010;"[Gasp]"
780;3833860;3835350;"Taki (as Mitsuha): Mitsuha."
781;3835350;3837980;"She's alive!"
782;3838630;3844330;"[Sobbing]"
783;3847510;3849580;"Let me guess, you're touching your boo-"
784;3849580;3850670;"[Gasp]"
785;3850930;3854770;"[Crying] Her sister!"
786;3856140;3858330;"Yotsuha!"
787;3858330;3859350;"Yotsuha: Ungh!"
788;3859350;3861670;"[Shudder]"
789;3861670;3864170;"I think she's finally lost it."
790;3864170;3867540;"Just for today, I-I'm gonna head out first..."
791;3867540;3868860;"She's lost it..."
792;3868860;3870070;"Really lost it..."
793;3870070;3871410;"Totally!"
794;3871410;3872660;"Totally..."
795;3872660;3878410;"-For all you stargazers out there, the comet Tiamat has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now."
796;3878410;3884770;"Tonight, it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 PM (19:40), and be at its maximum brightness when viewed from the Earth's..."
797;3884770;3887730;"It's tonight! There's still time left!"
798;3888160;3890220;"Mornin', Mitsuha!"
799;3890220;3892510;"What's this?"
800;3892510;3893850;"Hold on..."
801;3893850;3897690;"- You're not Mitsuha, are you? - W-wait, how did you-?"
802;3898120;3900170;"You already knew?"
803;3900170;3907200;"No, but watching the way you've been behaving lately stirred some memories up."
804;3907550;3909890;"When I was a young girl,"
805;3909890;3913010;"I had some pretty strange dreams myself."
806;3913010;3913810;"Huh?"
807;3913810;3920710;"Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became In those dreams have pretty much faded at this point."
808;3920710;3921940;"Faded?"
809;3921960;3927230;"Treasure the experience. Dreams eventually will fade away."
810;3927230;3930050;"I went through similar times myself,"
811;3930050;3932700;"and so did your mother."
812;3933200;3934310;"What if..."
813;3934310;3936960;"all those dreams that the Miyamizu people had!"
814;3936960;3939300;"It had to do with today!"
815;3939950;3942720;"Grandma, you have to listen to me!"
816;3943040;3944490;"Tonight,"
817;3944490;3946800;"the comet is going to fall on Itomori!"
818;3946800;3949190;"- You're all gonna die! - Huh?"
819;3955390;3957390;""Nobody's gonna believe that?""
820;3957390;3960340;"I didn't expect that out of Mitsuha's grandma."
821;3960340;3964270;"It doesn't matter! there's no way I'm gonna let them all die!"
822;3964820;3966280;"Mitsuha!"
823;3966280;3967820;"What happened... to-?"
824;3969150;3970550;"What'd you-?"
825;3970550;3971520;"Your hair!"
826;3971520;3976000;"-Ugh, the haircut? looked better before, huh? -No, i-i-it's good!"
827;3976000;3980690;"Nevermind that! If we don't do something about tonight, we'll all die!"
828;3982410;3985400;"It's up to us to save everyone!"
829;3989350;3991410;"Wait, shouldn't you be in school?"
830;3991410;3996120;"Well, we sort-of have to save the town, or something."
831;3996120;3997120;"Heh?"
832;3997820;4001380;"- The warning system? - Yeah, those speakers all over the town."
833;4001470;4004890;""Superimposition, frequency""
834;4005400;4008280;"I get it. It could work!"
835;4008280;4012540;"- Niiiice job, Teshi. - Hey, I don't think you should be sittin' so close to me."
836;4012540;4016150;"- What's wrong. Uh-oh! You shyyy? - Would you quit it?!"
837;4016150;4018400;"It ain't proper and you know it!"
838;4018400;4020880;""Club Discontinued - Keep Out""
839;4019680;4021830;"Taki (as Mitsuha): T-hahahahaha!"
840;4021830;4025130;"Such a gentleman."
841;4026060;4028000;"I bought all the snacks, guys."
842;4028000;4030470;"- Here's the change. - Sorry for the trouble."
843;4030470;4031470;"I didn't mind."
844;4031590;4034660;"- We oughta be gettin' paid. - Quit complaining."
845;4035500;4037670;"So? Wha'dcha come up with?"
846;4037670;4040080;"Got an evacuation plan?"
847;4043090;4044610;"A- A-"
848;4044610;4046020;"A BOMB?!"
849;4046020;4050370;"Yeah, we have water gel explosives we use for construction at our storage site."
850;4050370;4053010;"AND the warning system?"
851;4053360;4057150;"Our startup frequency can hijack the town's warning system pretty easily,"
852;4057150;4061340;"so we can broadcast an evacuation warning for the whole town right from school!"
853;4061380;4063690;"Look, we're outside the disaster area here,"
854;4063690;4066460;"so we'll just make an announcement to evacuate to the school."
855;4066460;4067770;"It's-"
856;4067770;4070970;"- It's totally a crime! - You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya."
857;4070970;4073460;"- Why me?! - You're in the Broadcast Club."
858;4073590;4077250;"- And I'll be in charge of the explosives. - While I go have a word with the mayor."
859;4077250;4082140;"- Why? - 'Cause if the evacuation order's not comin' from Town Hall, then nobody's gonna go anyway."
860;4082140;4085470;"But if I talk to the mayor, as his daughter, I can convince him."
861;4085470;4088120;"It's the perfect plan!"
862;4088700;4091300;"Fine, I don't really care one way or the other."
863;4091300;4094190;"This is just a theory of yours, right?"
864;4094800;4095810;"Well..."
865;4095810;4101590;"Theories can be based on reality. Like, do you know the story of how Itomori Lake was formed? It's a crater!"
866;4099750;4103750;""A meteor crater lake formed 1,200 years ago.""
867;4101590;4108090;"- That means a meteor hit this area at least once a thousand years ago! - Right. That's why-!"
868;4108090;4109890;"Nice one, Teshi!"
869;4113620;4115520;"- Let's go evacuate the town! - Let's go evacuate the town!"
870;4119700;4122710;"Mitsuha's Father: What on earth are you talking about?!"
871;4123720;4125040;"Like I said,"
872;4125040;4130000;"-We have to evacuate everyone In town before tonight or else- -Enough! Shut up!"
873;4134580;4138470;""The comet's going to split In two and strike the town?""
874;4138020;4141010;""Itomori Town Hall""
875;4138470;4141140;""Over 500 will die?""
876;4141140;4144620;"How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!"
877;4145110;4148030;"If you're serious, you must be sick!"
878;4148030;4152000;"I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait."
879;4152820;4156450;"I'll have a car take you to the city hospital for an examination."
880;4156450;4160380;"We will continue this discussion after you've seen a doctor."
881;4161820;4163880;"You!"
882;4164570;4168010;"You son of a- !"
883;4174440;4176000;"Mitsuha's Father: Mitsuha..."
884;4177020;4178390;"No..."
885;4178970;4180410;"Wait a minute..."
886;4181520;4183590;"Who are you?"
887;4198000;4201950;"-I'll see you guys at the festival, ba-bye! -We'll meet ya at the step stone shrine. Don't be late, k?"
888;4201950;4204910;"- Ba-bye! - Seeya! - Later!"
889;4206030;4207710;"You shouldn't go!"
890;4207710;4211880;"-You've got to leave town! tell all of your friends! -What's wrong with you?!"
891;4211880;4215300;"- Mitsuha! - What was that about? - Come on, let's go."
892;4215300;4217700;"What are you doing, huh?"
893;4218060;4220030;"If it was Mitsuha,"
894;4220030;4222320;"would she have been able to convince him?"
895;4222320;4224190;"- Is all this my fault?! - Huh?!"
896;4224190;4227930;"Yotsuha, promise me that you'll leave town with grandma before dark!"
897;4227930;4228570;"What?!"
898;4228570;4231670;"- You're gonna die if you stay here! - What are you talking about?!"
899;4231670;4237530;"And why did you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?! you've been acting really strange lately!"
900;4238300;4242750;"- Went to Tokyo? - Hey! Mitsuha!"
901;4244700;4246960;"How'd it go with your old man?"
902;4248810;4251250;"Hey, Mitsuha!"
903;4251250;4252900;"What's with your sister?"
904;4252900;4255280;"Don't know."
905;4262360;4263510;"[Ding]"
906;4264070;4266410;"Could she be over there?"
907;4266580;4268890;"What's that? What's over there?"
908;4269210;4272030;"- Let me use your bike, Teshi. - Hey."
909;4272030;4274040;"Mitsuha."
910;4274350;4276060;"And what do we do?"
911;4276060;4278200;"Get things ready like we planned!"
912;4278200;4280930;"I'm counting on you!"
913;4306360;4309010;"Mitsuha: Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again!"
914;4312090;4314630;"What's Taki doin' out here?"
915;4323710;4325480;"The town!"
916;4325480;4327370;"It's gone!"
917;4336780;4338000;"So..."
918;4338540;4340000;"does that mean..."
919;4342350;4344910;"I... died?!"
920;4354800;4356710;""Taki.""
921;4356710;4359020;""Taki!""
922;4360140;4361800;""Don't you remember?!""
923;4374520;4376550;"I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours."
924;4376550;4378370;"Wha? Right now?"
925;4378370;4379800;"- But why? - Uh..."
926;4379800;4381210;"For a date."
927;4381210;4385320;"- You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?! - I-I didn't say it was a date for me."
928;4386730;4389000;""I'll be back tonight.""
929;4391440;4397000;"Mitsuha: If I suddenly show up, will it be a nuisance or a surprise?"
930;4397000;4400000;"He might not like it if I do."
931;4407060;4411370;""The number you are trying to reach Is currently outside the cellular network.""
932;4411370;4414620;"I guess it won't happen, but..."
933;4414620;4416640;"What if it did?"
934;4416640;4418590;"What would I do?"
935;4418590;4420640;"Would I annoy him?"
936;4420330;4423330;""Tiamat Makes closest Approach Tomorrow""
937;4420640;4424750;"Would it be awkward, or maybe..."
938;4424750;4427990;"he'd be glad to see me."
939;4428300;4432590;""The number you are trying to reach Is currently outside the cellular network.""
940;4433350;4435870;"I guess we won't meet."
941;4436970;4441860;"But... there's one thing I'm certain of."
942;4442330;4444520;"If we see each other,"
943;4444520;4447320;"We'll definitely know right away..."
944;4447840;4451530;"that you were the one who was in me,"
945;4451530;4454800;"and that I was the one who was in..."
946;4454800;4456550;"- you. - Sorry!"
